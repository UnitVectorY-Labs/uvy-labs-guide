# Project Status

At UnitVectorY Labs, we use a standardized set of status levels to clearly communicate the current stage and activity level of our projects. This helps contributors and users quickly understand the development phase and support level they can expect.

By using these status levels, we aim to set clear expectations for the lifecycle and support level of our projects. Each project's status is prominently displayed with a shield badge on its repository page.

Our project status levels are defined as follows:

## Concept

![Concept](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Concept-white)

The project is in the early idea stage and may not have working code or a concrete plan for how it will progress. This is the earliest phase of a project.

## Work In Progress

![Work In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work%20In%20Progress-yellow)

The project is being actively developed but has not yet reached a point where it is recommended for use by others. Contributions are welcome but may be challenging as the code structure and documentation are incomplete at this phase.

## Active

![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-green)

The project has reached a point where it can be used by others. This typically means that a version has been released, but it does not necessarily indicate that the software has reached version 1.0 yet. An active project will receive updates and support. Contributions are welcome and encouraged.

## Suspended

Development on the project is on hold but may resume in the future, or the project may transition to abandoned.

## Abandoned

The project is no longer being developed or maintained, and users are advised to look for alternatives.
