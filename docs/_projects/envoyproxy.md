[authzjwtbearerinjector](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/authzjwtbearerinjector): A gRPC-based ExtAuthz service for Envoy Proxy that implements the jwt-bearer flow, injecting authentication credentials to backend services.

### GCP

[gcp-envoy-to-cloud-run-metadata-auth-tofu](https://github.com/UnitVectorY-Labs/gcp-envoy-to-cloud-run-metadata-auth-tofu): Demonstrates how to configure EnvoyProxy on Cloud Run to authenticate to a backend service, also running on Cloud Run, using GCPâ€™s metadata service for secure service-to-service authentication.
