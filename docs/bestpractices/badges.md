# Badges

On GitHub, badges are a way to provide quick information about the status of a project.  They are typically displayed in the README.md file of a project.  

The following are badges that are used in UnitVectorY Labs projects:

## License

The [licenses]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link bestpractices/licenses.md %}) of the specific project are included as a badge in the README.md file.

The following is the badge that is included in the README.md file of a project that uses the Apache License 2.0:

```markdown

```

The following is the badge that is included in the README.md file of a project that uses the Eclipse Public License 2.0:
